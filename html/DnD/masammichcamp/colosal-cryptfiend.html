										<h2 style="center">
											Colosal Crypt Fiend
										</h2>
										<p>
											This whole part was not a serious campain at all, it was "eveyone is level 20, everyone is Over Powered" type of game that was just ment to help teach 2 of the players basic actions and how a turn style game works. There were no character sheets, no open DnD books and no "real" dice, only a dice roller from wizard.com. 

											I did not take notes on what happened, nor did I record the session in anyway. So I will simply take down a small bit of notes on what happened for the history of it, in story format.

											The party consisted of "Severd" a character that i will call a "ranger" but was basicaly a "Hunter" from WOW, she also had a large pet wolf with her named "Blaze". A character i dont remember the name of who was a completly psycho pyromancer who has little to know memory of how to do anything but speak and eat, and a deeply hidden past even he rarely remembers, i may refer to him as a mage. Also a class that was reluctantly chosen once he realized that the party needed a tanky/heavy armor'd character so he went with a "warrior" as he called it, but eventually described it as "Guaren from League of Legends", named "Gritiem" but i may refer to him as a fighter.
										</p>
										<p>
											Everyone in the party kind of just "materialized" in an open field with knee high grass. Even though at first they had no idea how they got there, or who the others were, they all kind of had this crazy feeling that they had known the people around them for many years. The ranger felt as if her mind was being played with, but after takeing a look at her large wolf sitting at her side calm, she just desided to trust her memorys. The pyromancer forgets and remembers large chunks of his history on a regular basis so not knowing who he is with is just part of his daily. And the fighter just brushed it off as if he had been drinking and just woke up from a prolonged black out.

											They were all faceing North when they magically appeared in this field, so they continued in that direction, suddenly the ranger knotises something off putting. She has yet to field the wind even 1 time, there are no birds chirping, no crickets calling to each other for a good time, no animal prints in the dirt between the grass, and not even a light in the distance from a house, or a town. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Before she can voice this new found knowledge, a hand grabs the ancle of the mage and he lands flat on his face. Screaming for help almost imediatly he grabs a random stick and pokes the hand that is sticking out of the ground and the hand lets go. 

											Suddenly random moans are heard all around the small group, the 2 standing champions back against each other and face oposite directons while the mage starts screaming random words that are not understood by the other 2. Severds wolf Blaze hunkers down for a fight. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Hands, heads, feet, elbows, and ass's start popping up around the group all over the place. "RUN!" screams Severed, reaching down picking up the mage by the back of his robe and dragging him they all ran North ward as fast as possible. Laughing histerically the mage poked randomly at the air screaming something uninteligible but the word "fire" was used a lot. 

											Eventually they realized they were only heading deeper and deeper into this Zombie infested land, so once again they stop, but this time to fight to the death!
										</p>
										<p>
											The fighter started swinging his sword at zombies, with little issue he was killing at least 1 every hit, sliceing though zombies like a moletn chain saw. Severed was shooting zombies at point blank range as quick as she could draw her arrows (which is very fast mind you!), and the mage... well yea, he kind of just sat for a minute, doing nothing but smile, and laugh. He then realized that he should probably join the fight when a group of zombies started approching from his side of the group, so he stood up, and started pokeing zombies in the face with the stick he had picked up. But he wasnt just pokeing them in the face, no, he was also screaming "FIREBALL!" at the top of his longs! He managed to poke about 3 beofre anything even happened, he poked one in a open chest cavity where a sword had once carved a chunk out of him, and he screamed "FIREBALL!" again. But this time, instead of just coming out bloody, a massive fireball shot from the stick as if it was a 5 foot wide cannon, the further it traveled the larger the fireball became every zombie it came into contact with (or near) burst into flames or instantly was incenerated. This didnt seem to suprise the mage much though because he just kept pokeing in different directions at differnt zombies and screaming as if this was the last thing he would ever say. He ended up casting 3 massive sized fireballs, they left large chunks of scortched land in there wake, and almost no zombies were now coming at them from the west due, the few that still stood, were on fire, and catching the grass that had not yet felt the blaze, on fire.
										</p>
										<p>
											Something the pyromancer probably couldnt not have known was that at the sight of fire, Gretiem would almost instantly become inraged, and he did. He raged so hard he started screaming a sound that was almost uninteligible "DEMACIAAAAAA!" he screamed, as he charged forward (he was faceing south) weapon held straight out in his right hand, he continued to slay zombies as he decapitated many of them as he went. 

											Around this time Severed and the pyro realzed they had been listening to a strange chanting in the distance, seeming to come from all directions at once. A thousand voices rang out in some language only the mage could even bairly comprehend "NO MOM I DONT WANT ANY WAFFLES FOR BREAKFAST! LEAVE ME ALONE" screamed the mage. Ignoreing it him and debateing on shooting him in the head she continued takeing out zombies as fast as she could ((out of story, now that i think, idk where she got all of these arrows from...)) 

											The chanting grows in volume, and even seems to pick up pace. 

											Although the enraged Gretiem is oblivious (hes stopped to slice up a large gathering of zombies) there is a massive (~4 story in height and about as big around as a city block) crypt fiend was growing out of the ground (imagine hundreds of thousands of zombies being pulled together and melding flesh into 1 giant single consiousness being) 
										</p>
										<p>
											As the chanting becomes louder and faster it starts to actually become understandable (sort of) to the mage, he can hear the words that are spoken, but cant quite put them in an order that makes since. He knows its a spell, something about dead people or killing people, or something about cats? 

											Coming down from his rage, mainly due to he cannot walk with out almost being tripped by a corpse of the recently undead now redead. Gritiem looks to his left (the east) and sees the colosal monster generateing before him. But rather then bitch out, he
